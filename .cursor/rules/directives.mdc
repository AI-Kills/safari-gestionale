these are the general rules to always follow in this app: 


this is a nextjs application 
the components used are from shadcn, preferably from the components/ui/ directory
the style is given by tailwind classes (see tailwind.config.ts)
when implementing a CRUD operation remember the following 3 things: 

1. the server actions are in app/lib/actions/actions.ts, 
2. we use zod for validation, the zod schemas are in app/lib/actions/entity-zod-schemas.ts
3. the definitions of the entities of the database are in app/lib/definitions.ts

always maintain the definitions, the schemas and the actions synchronized

!! IMPORTANT:

never edit the package.json file changing the name of the app!!
never edit the next-env.d.ts unless explicitly required in the prompt!!
