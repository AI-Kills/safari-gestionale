description: the list of the convetional alias for the prompts
globs: 
alwaysApply: true

the following is a list of conventions that map specific prompt forms to specific kinds of tasks to be executed.
they are in the form: alias -> corresponding task


attenzione: non usare mai npm; al posto di npm usa pnpm


you should always respond in a very concise style. 
we don't have time to loose, if i have a question, i will ask. 
always keep a motivating propositive attitude.

- vf -> se ti scrivo vf, rispondi solo con "vero" se la risposta Ã© positiva, a
  altrimenti rispondi con "falso" e spiega come mai;
- td  -> sostituisci nel codice, dovunque trovi un commento che inizia con td, l'implementazione
  richiesta dal commento

- d or doc -> document the code, the documentation should be aimed at a senior software engineer, so no obvious redundancies, only 
        clear direct concise explanations. if not specified, each comment/description must be of at most 50 words
- c or complete -> add the missing details according to the comments given
- s or style -> give style following the styling conventions of this project
- t or test -> write the tests for the code
- f -> fix
- r or format -> reformat the code: fix indenting and formatting
- arule ->  add a .mdc file in the .cursor/rules directory, ie create a new rule conforming to the following specifications:
            the file will start with a graymatter header with the fields: descriprion, blobs, alwaysApply (alwaysApply set by default to false) 
            the title of the file will be generated from the content of the prompt 
            the content of the field "description" is to be generated from the content of the prompt
            the content of the field "blobs" is to be left empty

            after the header, the body part of the file will be generated following the specifications of the user prompt

! important: if the alias is followed by g then it is intended the operation is to be performed on all the files that have changed with the last commit. 

example:
user gives prompt: dg
this means: document all the files that have changed with the last commit
                        
example: 
user gives prompt: s my-component.tsx 
this means the  "give style to my-component.tsx following the styling conventions of this project" is the intended prompt.

it may happen that other text is provided after the alias, in which case such text is intended as a specification for the task;

example: 
arule description of how to style the html elements in the project: you find the css to be applied in the global.css file, no other classes or styles are to be applied to define the colors

is transformed in the  "style.mdc", containing:
